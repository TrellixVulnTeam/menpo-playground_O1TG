Welcome to the the Menpo Playground!
------------------------------------

Thanks for downloading the Menpo Playground!

To get started, just run `./get_started` from a terminal:
```
> ./get_started
```
This will do some final unpacking and then you will be good to go. Note that this
will only effect files within this folder - **Menpo Playground never touches
anything outside of this directory**.
