Getting Started
===============

Thanks for downloading Menpo Playground!

To get going we just need to unpack some extra files in this folder - just run `./get_started` from a terminal to do this.
Note that this will only affect files within this folder - **Menpo Playground never touches
anything outside of this directory**.

New to the terminal?
--------------------

If you are new to using the terminal here's a quick guide to get you started. Use spotlight to search for 'Terminal' - double-click to run it. We first need to get into the playground - if you downloaded the `menpo_playground.zip` file and unpacked it in the `Downloads` directory, that will mean using the `cd` command as so:
```
$ cd ~/Downloads/menpo_playground
```
Now you are in the right place, you can run the `./get_started` command - note that the starting `./` is needed:
```
~/Downloads/menpo_playground $ ./get_started
```
That's it! Once the command completes you'll find more content in this folder - checkout the `Readme.md` to start using Menpo!
