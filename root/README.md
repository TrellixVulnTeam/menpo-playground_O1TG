Welcome to the Menpo Playground!
================================

This directory contains:

1. A full isolated Python installation containing the Menpo Project with all its dependencies ready to go
2. A set of notebooks that you can run immediately to see how to use Menpo
3. Two command line tools, `menpofit`, and `menpodetect`, that can be used to locate bounding boxes and landmarks in challenging in-the-wild facial images.

There is no installation step, you just run executables in the downloaded folder.
To remove, simply delete the folder.
